# unicode-animatio Docs

## Root Package Docs

- [README](../README.md): public package overview, CLI examples, catalog notes,
  and brand/security boundary.
- [API compatibility](../API_COMPATIBILITY.md): supported import roots and
  stability posture.
- [Code quality](../CODE_QUALITY.md): contributor quality rules.
- [Release guide](../RELEASING.md): package release flow.

## Public Package Boundary

These docs are for external users and contributors. Keep them portable, avoid
machine-local path assumptions, and describe `unicode-animatio` as a standalone
Python distribution rather than as an OpenMinion-only implementation detail.
